# SDN

I didn't put much thought into the name, but SDN stands for "Software Developers Network" and is being built with a specific audience in mind - young, new developers.

Earlier this summer, I finished a course called Harvard CS50 which prepared me to work on legitimate software projects, including making web apps and mobile apps. But I felt like there was a problem - I didn't have many cohorts in my area to work on projects with to build my portfolio. I was transitioning betwen full time work and going back to school, wasn't confident enough to take on freelance work, and had a hard time coming up with ideas of projects to build to test my growing skillsets. Further, I read a lot of great posts about important skills that students don't learn until they join teams, and those included git versioning and overall cooperation with fellow Engineers, which I couldn't do unless I worked with Engineers.

So to solve for this, SDN could serve as a small social network via which students can post projects that they may be interested in trying and encourage other users to join them in the venture. The site's focus is to help Engineers connect and build experience working with local or remote Engineers and, more importantly, build their portfolios. This is an ongoing process that I will most likely create a few blog posts regarding on http://jayravaliya.com/blog/, but if you have any questions or are interested in getting involved, please reach out!

This project is currently in development.
