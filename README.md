# SDN

SDN stands for "Software Developers' Network" and is a web application I've been building to better understand the intricacies of managing user generated content from both a backend and frontend perspective. I wanted to build it after I realized that a lot of today's rising Software Developers come from different primary backgrounds, just as I did, and don't necessarily have hacker or developer communities via which they can collaborate on ideas and not only build portfolios, but build interesting things. SDN serves as a hub for rising devs to post ideas and connect with other devs to collaborate with.
